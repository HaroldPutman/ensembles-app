    <p class="ml-2 mt-2">The Deanne Moore Gallery invites artists to submit up to three (3) artworks for consideration in the Inaugural Exhibition of the Ensembles Center, Rhythm. </p>
    <p class="ml-2 mt-2">
        <strong class="font-bold">When we hear the word rhythm, we think of music. Beats. Tempos. Melodies. Rhythms that move us.</strong>
             Rhythm is, in fact, originally a music term that means movement patterns of musical notes and lyrics at a certain time. But rhythm also exists in nature as regularly recurrent changes as in seasons or in biological processes. Rhythm can exist in poetry as metre, a pattern of stressed and unstressed parts of words or alternations of strong and weak elements in speech.</p>
    <p class="ml-2 mt-2">There are various definitions of the word “rhythm.”  According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, rhythm is defined as “movement, fluctuation, or variation marked by the regular recurrence or natural flow of related elements”.</p>
    <p class="ml-2 mt-2">How does rhythm exist in your art? As geometrically structured patterns of lines or shapes?  Or do undulating, swirling, organic forms create rhythm and movement in your work? Would you describe your work as having hyper-energized rhythm or a calming fluid pulse?</p>
    <p class="ml-2 mt-2">Artists are encouraged to present contemporary works that celebrate rhythm in their own unique style to represent the diverse community we live in.</p>
    <h2 class="mt-4 font-bold text-black text-2xl">Requirements</h2>
